# ML-Concrete

This repository contains the Machine Learning algorithms employed to improve the numerical methods for the steel yield strain calculation in reinforced concrete members. Some Jupyter Notebooks are added for the sake of clarity and simplicity.

It is recomended to use `main.ipynb` for self tries. It needs `.xlsx` files like `kernel_shuffled.xlsx` or `bound_shuffled.xlsx` with data separated by classes. Also, `data_k` and `data_b` can be provided as pandas DataFrames, or be readed from other files.
